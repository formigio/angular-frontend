/*

 Possible Statuses
  - system_status      - System Status is set by the Platform, can have 3 possible values
  - - pending   - Default Status
  - - ready     - Required context is set (Ready Rule returns true)
  - - queued    - Claimed by a worker and commitment promised (Derived from Commitment)
  - - closed    - System considers this closable (Done Rule returns true)
  - worker_status      - Worker Status set by Worker, can have 5 possible values
  - - notstarted - Default Status
  - - scheduled  - moved to this state when commitment is saved
  - - started    - Worker Marked as work started (Stored Flag, worker marks as started)
  - - paused     - Worker Marked as work paused (Stored Flag, worker marks as paused)
  - - blocked    - Worker Marked as complete (Stored Flag, worker marks as blocked)
  - - completed  - Worker Marked as complete (Stored Flag, worker marks as completed)
  - done               - State Calculated as Done (Derived from Rule - Evaluation of Doneness Rule)
